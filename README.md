# A Symfony pre commit hook
==========================
Checks in our pre-commit hook 

* Syntax check with php lint (“php -l”): We check every committed file has a valid PHP syntax.
* Sync check of composer.json and composer.lock files: We check these two files are committed together in order to avoid committing the json but not the lock and generate some issue to another developers.
* PHP CS Fixer check: With the –dry-run parameter it does not fix, just say what the problems are. With the –fixers parameter you can control what fixers you want to execute.
* PHP Code Sniffer check: Same as before, but another rule that checks another rules.
* PHPMD: We have enabled the controversial rules.
* Unit Testing check: We run around 3.000 tests right now.
